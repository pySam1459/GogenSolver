## What is a Gogen
A Gogen is a word puzzle, consisting of a 5x5 grid which is to be filled with unique letters A-Y.
The corner, edge and centre cells in the grid are prefilled with letters.
Alongside the grid, a list of words are given. 
Your goal is to fill in the missing letters so that each word can be spelled out by tracing their letters through the grid, 
moving from 1 cell to any of the 8 surrounding cells.

By using logical reasoning techniques, you are able to deduce which letter goes where in the grid.
